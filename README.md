# PDF Merger

## Usage

1. Download the `merger.py`
2. Put all `pdf` files that you want to merge into a folder (we'll call it `InputFolder`) in the same directory as `merger.py`
3. Run `py converter.py InputFolder/ name_of_merged_pdf_file` on the terminal, replacing `name_of_merged_pdf_file` with what you name the merged file
4. The merged file should be in the same directory as `merger.py`

Enjoy!
